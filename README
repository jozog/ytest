1. What is ytest ?
------------------

A PHP library extending PHPUnit, and based on the runkit extension.
Useful mainly to stub/mock private and static methods easily.
Also provides some other helpers.

Has been used in a real-life project of the real-world,
so has a chance to be useful...

2. Requirements:
----------------

 - PHP >= 5.2 on GNU/Linux
 - PHPUnit >= 3.4.12
 - runkit ( The fork which works, by D.Zenovich  https://github.com/zenovich/runkit )
 
 + MySQL 5 as an optional dependency (required for ytest's sample)

3. Installation (on GNU/linux)
------------------------------

3.1 Make ytest's sample work in your PHP environment
----------------------------------------------------

3.1.1
-----
  Extract ytest's archive in some folder, say "/home/foo/libs/ytest".
  You get something like this:

  -- ytest
     `
     |-- config
     |-- docs
     |-- tests
     `-- libs
         `-- ytest

3.1.2
-----
  Install PHPUnit >= 3.4.12 if you haven't already.  
  Assuming PHPUnit's phpunit.php lies in /home/foo/libs/phpunit,
  make a symbolic link so that ytest can find it:

  $ cd /home/foo/ytest
  $ ln -s /home/foo/libs/phpunit libs/phpunit

3.1.3
-----
  Install Dmitry Zenovich's runkit version.
  You can take the latest version here:
  https://github.com/zenovich/runkit/downloads

  You'll have to build runkit yourself, and install it as a PHP extension 
  in your system. Here's a quick summary of how to do it (which might be outdated):

  $ cd runkit-1.0.3
  $ phpize
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
  $ sudo nano /etc/php5/cli/php.ini

    With nano, add the following lines at the end of your php.ini (for CLI since
    the unit tests will be run on the command line):
    
      extension=runkit.so
      runkit.internal_override=1

3.1.4
-----

Setup MySQL, or you may have some troubles:
  - Create a database named "ytest".
  - Create a user named "ytest" with full privileges on the "ytest" database.

3.1.5
-----

You should be able to run ytest's example test like this:
    $ cd /home/foo/ytest
    $ ./run_tests

You should see something like this:

    PHPUnit 3.4.12 by Sebastian Bergmann.

    ...............................

    Time: 0 seconds, Memory: 4.75Mb

    OK (31 tests, 48 assertions)

This means that ytest's sample test, tests/FooBarTest.php,
has been executed correctly.
(You can take a look at this test, but it's a bit boring,
you'll probably be better with the ytest docs.)


3.2 Integrating ytest with your own test suite
----------------------------------------------

Now that ytest is functional on your PHP system,
there are two cases:

- If you have no unit tests yet, you can simply add more test files
  along FooBarTest.php in ytest/tests to test your own stuff.
  To access the ytest extensions from your test cases, you simply
  have to make your test cases inherit from yTest_CustomTestCase.
  To run your tests, use the run_tests script.

- If you already have a test suite (and maybe some 
  helper scripts around), you may either:

  - Simply put all your existing test files in ytest/tests,
    and see if it works and suits you. This is the easy way.

  - Or, integrate only the bare ytest library in your system,
    by putting ytest/libs/ytest in your PHP include path.

    In this case you'll have to require the main ytest file
    from your test scripts, for example like this:

    	 require_once 'ytest/libs/ytest/ytest.php';
    
    Then you'll have to initialize ytest at the beginning
    of your test suite (like what is done in ytest/Bootstrap.php),
    something like this:

	 yTest_init("ytest/config/ytest_config.php",   // path to your config file for ytest
	            "ytest/libs/ytest",                // path to the ytest library folder
		    "ytest/libs/phpunit"               // path to PHPUnit
         	   );
  
    You'll have to tune the folders (and probably use absolute paths).
